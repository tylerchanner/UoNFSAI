    ```

## 6. ROS Bridge

1. Install ROS Bridge dependencies
    ```
    sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-tf2-geometry-msgs python-catkin-tools ros-melodic-rqt-multiplot ros-melodic-joy ros-melodic-cv-bridge ros-melodic-image-transport libyaml-cpp-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
    ```
2. Install `git-lfs`
    ```
    sudo apt install git-lfs
    ```
3. Clone the FSDS repository (Must be cloned into the home directory) (`$HOME/Formula-Student-Driverless-Simulator`)
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/FS-Driverless/Formula-Student-Driverless-Simulator.git --recurse-submodules
    ```
4. Checkout the required FSDS version
    ```
    cd ~/Formula-Student-Driverless-Simulator
    ```
    ```
    git checkout tags/v2.2.0
    ```

## 7. AirLib

1. Run the AirSim setup script

    ```
    ```
    catkin init
    ```
    ```
    catkin build
    ```

## 9. Launching ROS Bridge

1. All ROS Bridge nodes can be launched using `fsds_ros_bridge.launch` (ROS Bridge reads settings from `~/Formula-Student-Driverless-Simulator/settings.json`) (Ensure the settings are the same as the FSDS settings)
    ```
    cd ~/Formula-Student-Driverless-Simulator/ros
    ```
    ```
    source devel/setup.bash
    ```
    ```
    roslaunch fsds_ros_bridge fsds_ros_bridge.launch
    ```

## 10. Required Python Libraries

1. Install Python libraries (Install libraries separately to avoid cross-dependency errors) (`opencv-contrib-python` install may take `1-2hrs` to execute)
    ```
    cd ~
    ```
    ```
    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
    ```
    ```
    pip3 install scikit-build
    ```
    ```
    pip3 install matplotlib
    ```
    ```
    pip3 install numpy
    ```
    ```
    pip3 install opencv-contrib-python
    ```
2. Install `msgpack-rpc-python` library
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/msgpack-rpc/msgpack-rpc-python.git
    ```
    ```
    cd msgpack-rpc-python
    ```
    ```
    pip3 install .
    ```

## 11. Test Run Whole System

1. Ensure both `settings.json` files are the exact same
2. `Formula-Student-Driverless-Simulator` `settings.json` and `fsds-v2.2.0-windows` `settings.json` must be the following (for now)

    ```json
    {
    "SettingsVersion": 1.2,
    "Vehicles": {
        "FSCar": {
        "DefaultVehicleState": "",
        "EnableCollisionPassthrogh": false,
        "EnableCollisions": true,
        "AllowAPIAlways": true,
        "RC":{
            "RemoteControlID": -1
        },
        "Sensors": {
            "Gps" : {
            "SensorType": 3,
            "Enabled": true
            },
            "Lidar": {
            "SensorType": 6,
            "Enabled": true,
            "X": 1.3, "Y": 0, "Z": 0.1,
            "Roll": 0, "Pitch": 0, "Yaw" : 0,
            "NumberOfLasers": 1,
            "PointsPerScan": 500,
            "VerticalFOVUpper": 0,
            "VerticalFOVLower": 0,
            "HorizontalFOVStart": -90,
            "HorizontalFOVEnd": 90,
            "RotationsPerSecond": 10,
            "DrawDebugPoints": true
            }
        },
        "Cameras": {},
        "X": 0, "Y": 0, "Z": 0,
        "Pitch": 0, "Roll": 0, "Yaw": 0
        }
    }
    }
    ```
2. Close all Ubuntu terminals
3. Launch `FSDS.exe`, then run with spectator server
5. Open `1st Ubuntu terminal`, to ROS and launch ROS Bridge 
    ```
    cd Formula-Student-Driverless-Simulator/ros
    ```
    ```
    source devel/setup.bash
    ```
    ```
    roslaunch fsds_ros_bridge fsds_ros_bridge.launch
    ```
6. Open `2nd Ubuntu terminal`, to python code and run script
    ```
    cd Formula-Student-Driverless-Simulator/python/examples
    ```
    ```
    python3 autonomous_example.py
    ```
7. Check if the model car is moving in the FSDS.exe

## Success!
1. Congrats! You’ve now done what has taken us FOREVER to sort out in a lot less time (I spent 4 hours in the CS lab on one error).

2. If there are any errors or improvements for this setup guide, please let us know or put in a pull request for amends.

3. Great success! Now go test your own scripts on the simulator you just set up!
